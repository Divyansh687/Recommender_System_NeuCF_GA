# Recommender_System_NeuCF_GA
Optimizing Recommender System using NeuCF and Genetic Algorithm
Recommender Systems are software tools and approaches that provide recommendations for items that
a user would find useful. The recommendations are intended to assist users in different
decision-making processes, such as deciding what to buy, what music to listen to, or what news to read.
Recommender systems have shown to be an effective way for internet users to cope with information
overload, and they have grown in popularity to become one of the most powerful and widely used tools
in electronic commerce. As a result, several strategies for suggestion generation have been presented,
and many of these have been effectively used in business situations during the previous decade.
Individuals who lack adequate personal experience or skill to assess the potentially overwhelming
amount of alternative things that a Web site, for example, may provide are the primary target of RS’s.

The following are some of the stages involved in this project:
● The dataset is separated into training and testing data after pre-processing. 75 percent of the rows
in the balanced dataset will be utilized to train the ANN model, while the remaining 25% will be
used for testing.
● An artificial neural network is used to anticipate a user's rating of a particular film.
● In order to enhance movie rating prediction, a Genetic Algorithm is used to develop an optimum
topology for Artificial Neural Network.
● The accuracy of the constructed model is then determined by comparing predicted and real movie
ratings.
